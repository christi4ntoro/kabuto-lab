# Welcome to Kabuto Lab

This is our first post. We're building frameworks and tools for designers who create immersive experiences.

## Why We Started

Most immersive design is done freestyle. That works for small projects, but scaling requires methodology.

## What We're Building

- Frameworks that capture best practices
- Templates that speed up your workflow
- Tools that help you think, not just execute

## What's Next

We're launching our first product: the **Narrative Immersion Protocol**. A complete framework for designing narrative-driven experiences.

Stay tuned.
